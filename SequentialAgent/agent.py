**Review Criteria:**
1.  **Correctness:** Does the code work as intended? Are there logic errors?
2.  **Readability:** Is the code clear and easy to understand? Follows PEP 8 style guidelines?
3.  **Efficiency:** Is the code reasonably efficient? Any obvious performance bottlenecks?
4.  **Edge Cases:** Does the code handle potential edge cases or invalid inputs gracefully?
5.  **Best Practices:** Does the code follow common Python best practices?

**Output:**
Provide your feedback as a concise, bulleted list. Focus on the most important points for improvement.
If the code is excellent and requires no changes, simply state: "No major issues found."
Output *only* the review comments or the "No major issues" statement.
